          <h2>Why I’m Building a New Job Board for New Zealand and Australia</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Job hunting is already a tough and emotional process — especially in a competitive market like New Zealand or Australia. Yet in 2025, many of us are still using outdated platforms that haven’t kept up with how people actually search for jobs today.</p>

        <p>I’ve personally felt this pain while job hunting: irrelevant listings, poor filtering, outdated UI, and slow results. And after talking to friends, colleagues, and recruiters — I realized I’m not the only one.</p>

        <h3>What’s wrong with the status quo?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clunky interfaces and slow loading times</li>
          <li>Filters that don’t work (or don’t exist)</li>
          <li>No way to easily find remote roles or visa-sponsored positions</li>
          <li>Outdated or duplicate listings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I’m building instead</h3>
        <p>Findwise is a job board designed from the ground up to solve these issues. Here's how:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI-powered search:</strong> Find relevant listings faster, with smarter matching.</li>
          <li><strong>Modern, minimal UI:</strong> Easy to navigate on mobile and desktop.</li>
          <li><strong>Powerful filters:</strong> Remote-only, part-time, contract, sponsorship — all at your fingertips.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent employer tools:</strong> No blind ads. Real listings with real info.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why now?</h3>
        <p>Tech is advancing quickly, and job seekers are more tech-savvy than ever — but job boards haven’t evolved. I believe it’s time for a better experience tailored to how we actually search for work in 2025.</p>

        <h3>Want to help shape it?</h3>
        <p>I’ve launched a simple <a href="https://findwise.co.nz">early-access landing page</a> to gather feedback and interest. If you're a job seeker or employer in NZ or AU, your voice will help shape this from the start.</p>
